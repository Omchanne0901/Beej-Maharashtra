                       <h4>More Information:The soybean, soy bean, or soya bean (Glycine max)[3] is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean, which has numerous uses.

                        Traditional unfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk, from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, natt≈ç, and tempeh. Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes.[4]
                        
                        Soybeans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Soybean is the most important protein source for feed farm animals (that in turn yields animal protein for human consumption).</h4>

                       <h4>More Information:Cotton seeds are the seeds of the cotton plant. Cotton seeds are ovoid, 3.5-10 mm long. They are densely covered with white or rusty, long and woolly hairs, called the lint, which is the main product used to make cotton textiles, and shorter hairs (linters). Commercially available cotton seeds are usually the by-product of the production of cotton fibre by a cotton gin, which separates the lint from the seeds. Consequently, seed production is dominated by factors determining the production of cotton fiber and the seed is about 15-20% of the value of the cotton crop (O'Brien et al., 2005). Depending on the species and variety, cotton lint has different colours (black, brown or red), and may be long and thin (Gossypium hirsutum, 90% of world production), longer and finer (Gossypium barbadense, also called Egyptian cotton) or shorter and thicker (Gossypium herbaceum and Gossypium arboretum) (Ikitoo, 2011; Rossin, 2009).

                        Once ginned, the cotton seed remains covered with linters and called whole cottonseed or fuzzy cottonseed. The amount of linters left on the seeds varies from 4 to 8%, except for seeds of Gossypium barbadense varieties, such as the American Pima cotton, which are naturally without linters (NCPA, 2012). Linters are a valuable fibre used for paper, cellulose acetate, viscose, explosives, plastic or photographic film. Fuzzy cotton seeds are subject to a mechanical delinting process that yields linters and naked seeds called delinted cottonseed or black or slick cottonseed (Hoffman, 1998). Cotton seeds intended for sowing generally undergo chemical (sulphuric acid) treatment in order to remove linters but these delinted seeds (sometimes called acid cottonseed) should not be used as feed as they may contain chemicals residues and can have an unpalatable flavour (Smith et al., 1999). 
                        
                        Fuzzy or delinted cotton seeds may be either fed to livestock or submitted to oil extraction, yielding oil, cottonseed meal and hulls. Cotton seeds contain about 20% of valuable cooking oil. A typical cottonseed crushing operation separates the seed into oil (16%), hulls (26%), meal (45.5%) and linters (8.5%) (O'Brien et al., 2005)</h4>

                            <h4>More Information:Mustard seeds generally take eight to ten days to germinate if placed under the proper conditions, which include a cold atmosphere and relatively moist soil. Mature mustard plants grow into shrubs.
     
                             Yellow mustard has a plant maturity of 85 to 90 days; whereas, brown and oriental mustard have a plant maturity of 90 to 95 days. If the temperature conditions are conducive to growth, a mustard plant will begin to bud five weeks after the seedlings have appeared. The plant will reach full bloom 7 to 10 days later. Brown or oriental varieties of mustard tend to have higher yields compared to yellow mustard.[3] Seed yield is also related to the bloom period. In other words, the longer the bloom period, the greater the seed yield.[4]
                             
                             Mustard grows well in temperate regions. Major producers of mustard seeds include India, Pakistan, Canada, Nepal, Hungary, Great Britain and the United States. Brown and black mustard seeds return higher yields than their yellow counterparts.[5]
                             
                             In Pakistan, rapeseed-mustard is the second most important source of oil, after cotton. It is cultivated over an area of 307,000 hectares with an annual production of 233,000 tonnes and contributes about 17% to the domestic production of edible oil.
                             
                             Mustard seeds are a rich source of oil and protein. The seed has oil as high as 46-48%, and whole seed meal has 43.6% protein.</h4>
